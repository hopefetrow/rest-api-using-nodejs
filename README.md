# rest-api-using-nodejs

A function app with two Serverless functions, Person and Planet, that are triggered by HTTP calls. Both have an inbound processing rule for routing. Route templates are configured so that the functions receive data using both query parameters and path parameters. An API management instance exposes the two functions as a unique, homogenous API that uses path parameters by using inbound processing rules.
